	abstract={We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

    abstract = "{Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",

Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.},

  abstract = 	 {The Transformer architecture has achieved considerable success recently; the key component of the Transformer is the attention layer that enables the model to focus on important regions within an input sequence. Gradient optimization with attention layers can be notoriously difficult requiring tricks such as learning rate warmup to prevent divergence. As Transformer models are becoming larger and more expensive to train, recent research has focused on understanding and improving optimization in these architectures. In this work our contributions are two-fold: we first investigate and empirically validate the source of optimization problems in the encoder-decoder Transformer architecture; we then propose a new weight initialization scheme with theoretical justification, that enables training without warmup or layer normalization. Empirical results on public machine translation benchmarks show that our approach achieves leading accuracy, allowing to train deep Transformer models with 200 layers in both encoder and decoder (over 1000 attention/MLP blocks) without difficulty.

The focus is on a general overview based on a taxonomy of system functionalities, broken down into four processes: initialization, tracking, pose estimation, and recognition. Each process is discussed and divided into subprocesses and/or categories of methods to provide a reference to describe and compare the more than 130 publications covered by the survey. References are included throughout the paper to exemplify important issues and their relations to the various methods. A number of general assumptions used in this research field are identified and the character of these assumptions indicates that the research field is still in an early stage of development. To evaluate the state of the art, the major application areas are identified and performances are analyzed in light of the methods presented in the survey. Finally, suggestions for future research directions are offered.}

A number of significant research advances are identified together with novel methodologies for automatic initialization, tracking, pose estimation, and movement recognition. Recent research has addressed reliable tracking and pose estimation in natural scenes. Progress has also been made towards automatic understanding of human actions and behavior. This survey reviews recent trends in video-based human capture and analysis, as well as discussing open problems for future research to achieve automatic visual analysis of human movement.}

The significant research effort in this domain has been motivated by the fact that many application areas, including surveillance, HumanâComputer Interaction and automatic annotation, will benefit from a robust solution. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of human motion analysis. We divide the analysis into a modeling and an estimation phase. Modeling is the construction of the likelihood function, estimation is concerned with finding the most likely pose given the likelihood surface. We discuss model-free approaches separately. This taxonomy allows us to highlight trends in the domain and to point out limitations of the current state of the art.}

Main challenges for human pose estimation are variation of body poses, complicated background and depth ambiguities. To solve these problems, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the related fields. In this survey, we focus our attention on the recent advances in vision-based human pose estimation. We first present a general framework of human pose estimation, and then go through the latest technical progress on each stage. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the existing approaches and foresee the future directions to be explored.}

  abstract={Human pose estimation refers to the estimation of the location of body parts and how they are connected in an image. Human pose estimation from monocular images has wide applications (e.g., image indexing). Several surveys on human pose estimation can be found in the literature, but they focus on a certain category; for example, model-based approaches or human motion analysis, etc. As far as we know, an overall review of this problem domain has yet to be provided. Furthermore, recent advancements based on deep learning have brought novel algorithms for this problem. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of human pose estimation from monocular images is carried out including milestone works and recent advancements. Based on one standard pipeline for the solution of computer vision problems, this survey splits the problem into several modules: feature extraction and description, human body models, and modeling methods. Problem modeling methods are approached based on two means of categorization in this survey. One way to categorize includes top-down and bottom-up methods, and another way includes generative and discriminative methods. Considering the fact that one direct application of human pose estimation is to provide initialization for automatic video surveillance, there are additional sections for motion-related methods in all modules: motion features, motion models, and motion-based methods. Finally, the paper also collects 26 publicly available data sets for validation and provides error measurement methods that are frequently used.},

  abstract = {Estimating the pose of a human in 3D given an image or a video has recently received significant attention from the scientific community. The main reasons for this trend are the ever increasing new range of applications (e.g., human-robot interaction, gaming, sports performance analysis) which are driven by current technological advances. Although recent approaches have dealt with several challenges and have reported remarkable results, 3D pose estimation remains a largely unsolved problem because real-life applications impose several challenges which are not fully addressed by existing methods. For example, estimating the 3D pose of multiple people in an outdoor environment remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we review the recent advances in 3D human pose estimation from RGB images or image sequences. We propose a taxonomy of the approaches based on the input (e.g., single image or video, monocular or multi-view) and in each case we categorize the methods according to their key characteristics. To provide an overview of the current capabilities, we conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches in a synthetic dataset created specifically for this task, which along with its ground truth is made publicly available for research purposes. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the insights obtained from reviewing the literature and the results of our experiments. Future directions and challenges are identified.}

  abstract={In this paper we present a computationally efficient framework for part-based modeling and recognition of objects. Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images.},

  abstract = {Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.}
